My 2 minute summary of virtual environments:

=====================================
Install the environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml
activate python-class
pip install -r requirements.txt

=====================================
To delete the environment:

conda remove --name python-class --all

=====================================
Share the environment:
Exporting the environment is a little tricky because Wayfair's wonky permissions don't work with the automated process.

Step 1, the automated process:
activate python-class
conda env export > environment.yml

Now, edit environment.yml
Delete the line starting with prefix: 
Delete the line starting with pip: 
Cut everything below the pip: line to the end of the file and save.


Open a new file in notepad
Paste the pip section you just cut
Delete the - that starts every line
Save this as requirements.txt (make sure it's in the same directory as environment.yml)
